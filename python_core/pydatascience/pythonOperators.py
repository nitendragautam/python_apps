# Arithmetic Operators
100+200 ## Add two numbers using +
200 - 20 # subtract a number with -
6 * 4  # Multiply two numbers with *
print(35/2)  # Divide a number by another number using / sign
print(35 //2 ) # Integer dividing numbers using //. Rounds up the remainder
2 ^ 8 # Raise to the power using ^ sign
22 % 7 #Modulus Division of a Number with another number


## Numerical Comparision Operator

4 == 4 # Equality check with == operator
4 != 4 # Inequality check with !=
4 > 3 # Greater than check with >
4 >=4 # Greater than or equal to check with >=
3 < 4 # Less than check with <
6 <= 7 #Less than or equal to check with <=

## Logical Operators

~(3 == 3) # Logical not with ~ sign
(2 != 3) & (3 < 4) #Logical AND with &
(2 >= 2) | ( 3 < 8) #Logical OR with |
(2 != 2) ^ (2 < 3) #Logical XOR with ^ sign
